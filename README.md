# MidoriBB

MidoriBB is a typical BBS, but implemented in JavaScript rather than Pretty Hopeless Programming script (PHP).
I wanted something that I could use for staying in contact with guild mates in WoW, but couldn't find anything
that matched my needs amongst existing options (awesome, free, written in JS), so I decided to build my own.

Midori is currently a very early work in progress.
